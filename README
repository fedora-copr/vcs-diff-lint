Differential linting for your VCS repo
======================================

Analyze code, and print only reports related to a particular change.

From within a VCS directory (only Git is supported for now) first
- analyze set of changed files against given changeset (origin/main by default)
  so we know what files need to be analyzed,
- run code analyzers (e.g. PyLint) against the old code (before changes), then
- run analyzers against the actual code (not yet pushed changes),
- perform a diff (using csdiff), and finally
- print a set of added (or even fixed, as opt-in) analyzers' warnings.


Features
--------

- PyLint and Mypy support
- monorepo support (multiple sub-projects in repo sub-directories)
- file renames supported (if a file was just renamed, reports in the new
  filename are not reported as new)

Usage
-----

Use the https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vcs-diff-lint GitHub Action.

Alternatively, in a local git clone directory, run:

    $ cd my_project && vcs-diff-lint
